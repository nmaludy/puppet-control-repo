Add .yaml files here that override specific settings for a given profile:: class.

These can be useful for profiles that are not included in base.yaml but still
need a default value. In that case, this is the folder to place them.

The names of the .yaml files should be the fully qualified class name, example:
profile::mysql.yaml
